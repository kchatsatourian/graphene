# Roadmap

This document outlines the goals set for this project. There might be slight modifications in the roadmap from time to
time. You are welcome to submit pull requests.

### 1. UI

- Improve the user interface of `chapter.html`. I am open to suggestions.
- Add D3.js configuration tools in canvas using a [modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/modals/) or a
  customized [sidebar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/sidebars/) that will act as a drawer.
- Add a dark theme or night mode which follows system theme or user preference but can be toggled from the navigation
  bar.
- Add translations and let the user change the language from navigation bar.

### 2. Merge GreedyCanvas with MinimumSpanningTreeCanvas.

### 3. Add more topics

Here, the aim is to expand the list of chapters in order to cover more topics. A list of topics will be updated soon.
