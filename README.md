## üìà Graph Theory

> In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise
> relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are
> connected by edges (also called links or lines).

## üíª Graphene

Graphene is a front-end project aimed at anyone who wants to learn graph theory. It provides a quick and interactive
introduction to the subject. The visuals used in the project makes it an effective learning tool.

## üéì Completed Topics

The whole content is broken in several chapters. So far these chapters have been added.

The project is still expanding. New topics are added from time to time.

## üìÖ Future Topics

These topics are planned to be added.

- Planar Graphs
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

So, keep checking for updates. :smile:
